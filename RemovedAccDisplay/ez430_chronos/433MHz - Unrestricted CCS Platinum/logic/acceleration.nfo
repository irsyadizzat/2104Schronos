These functions may be recursive:
	display_acceleration()
	do_acceleration_measurement()
	sx_acceleration()

Making this function inlineable: is_acceleration_measurement()

Making this function inlineable: acceleration_value_is_positive()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	bmp_as_get_data()
	bmp_as_stop()
	display_symbol()
	int_to_array()
	bmp_as_start()
	display_chars()
