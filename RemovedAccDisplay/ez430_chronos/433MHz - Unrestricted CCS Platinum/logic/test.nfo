		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void display_all_off() is called from 2 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 18 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void display_all_on() is called from 1 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 18 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:

extern void test_mode() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 243 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	display_all_on() (1 times)
	bmp_as_stop() (1 times)
